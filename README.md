# Deep Reinforcement Learning with Keras



just clone and open the reinforcement_learning_pong_keras_policy_gradients.ipynb file for step by step tutorial
[or click here to view on github](/reinforcement_learning_pong_keras_policy_gradients.ipynb)

we train a simple 200 hidden neuron network and a convolutional model.

sample gif playing of simple network:

In this short project we are gonna **train a neural network to play Pong game** using a reinforcement learning algorithm (**Policy Gradients Method - REINFORCE**). 

Considering **limited time** and for **learning purposes** I am **not aiming for a perfect trained agent**, but i hope this project could help people get familiar with basic process of rl algorithms and keras. The above video took 3 days for agent to learn on a slow computer. to obtain production results, a lot of more training and tuning is required which is not our focus. 

prerequisites:
familiarity with neural networks,supervised learning, tensorflow and keras, openai gym
